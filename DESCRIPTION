Description: The exact bootstrap method is a practical tool for exploring
    the distribution of small sample size data. For a sample of size n, the
    exact bootstrap method generates the entire space of n to the power of n
    resamples and calculates all realizations of the selected statistic. The 
    'exactamente' package includes functions for implementing two bootstrap
    methods: the exact bootstrap, and the regular bootstrap, which allow users
    to delve deeper into the characteristics of their small datasets through
    unique resampling techniques. The exact_bootstrap() function applies the
    exact bootstrap method, a techniques designed for small datasets, following
    methodologies outlined in Kisielinska (2013) <doi:10.1007/s00180-012-0350-0>.
    The regular_bootstrap() function offers a more traditional bootstrap approach,
    where users can determine the number of resamples. A distinctive feature of
    'exactamente' is the e_vs_r() function, which allows users to directly compare
    results from these bootstrap methods. To augment user experience, 'exactamente'
    also includes the exactamente_app() function that launches an interactive
    'shiny' web application. This application facilitates exploration and
    comparison of the bootstrap methods, providing options for modifying various
    parameters and visualizing results. As such, the 'exactamente' package serves
    to bridge the gap between understanding statistical bootstrap methods and
    applying them effectively to small datasets.
