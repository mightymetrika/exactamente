Description: The `exactamente` package offers practical tools for exploring
    bootstrap methods on small sample size data. The package includes functions
    for implementing three distinct bootstrap methods: exact case bootstrap,
    exact bootstrap, and regular bootstrap, which allow users to delve deeper
    into the characteristics of their small datasets through unique resampling
    techniques. The ecase_bootstrap() function implements the exact case
    bootstrap method, while the exact_bootstrap() function applies the exact
    bootstrap method. Both of these techniques, specifically designed for small
    datasets, follow methodologies outlined in Jekel & Romero (2020) <doi:10.2172/1605343>.
    The regular_bootstrap() function offers a more traditional bootstrap approach,
    where users can determine the number of resamples. A distinctive feature of
    `exactamente` is the e_vs_r() function, which allows users to directly compare
    results from these three bootstrap methods. To augment user experience,
    `exactamente` also includes the exactamente_app() function that launches an
    interactive Shiny app. This app facilitates exploration and comparison of the
    different bootstrap methods, providing options for modifying various parameters
    and visualizing results. As such, the `exactamente` package serves to bridge
    the gap between understanding statistical bootstrap methods and applying them
    effectively to small datasets.
